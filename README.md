**Statistics of Fitness Industry**

The fitness industry, valued at 160 billion USD in 2021, is forecasted to experience robust growth, projected to increase by 171% to reach 435 billion USD by 2028 (Rizzo, 2021). While the pandemic dealt a severe blow to the industry, resulting in a 58% decline, it is now showing signs of gradual recovery.

Conversely, the online and digital fitness app and equipment sector witnessed a remarkable 40% surge in growth throughout 2020, with projections indicating an impressive 63% expansion by the end of 2021. This stands in stark contrast to the gym industry, which saw the slowest growth rate at just 7% per year, while the digital fitness segment maintained a steady annual growth of 33% (Rizzo, 2021).

While the gym industry has historically served as the primary cornerstone of the fitness sector, contributing a substantial 61% of the industry's revenue, totalling 96.7 billion USD in 2019(Statista, n.d.), forecasts anticipate a notable shift. By 2028, it is projected that the gym industry's share of the fitness market will decrease significantly, representing only 30% of the industry's overall revenue, which is expected to reach 131.9 billion USD. This transformation underscores the changing landscape of fitness preferences and consumption patterns, with a growing emphasis on alternative fitness avenues (Tagliaferro, 2022).
 
In the future, the fitness industry is poised to be chiefly shaped by two key segments: fitness trackers and online/digital fitness platforms. Fitness trackers, currently valued at 25.6 billion USD with a 16% market share, are projected to maintain that share and generate a substantial revenue of 114.3 billion USD. In contrast, the online/digital platform, presently holding a modest 4% market share, is expected to see remarkable growth, reaching an 18% market share and amassing 79.1 billion USD in revenue by 2028, a considerable leap from its 2019 revenue of 6.1 billion USD(Tagliaferro, 2022).


**Problem we are trying to solve**
